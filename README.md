# Tales

synyx presentation style for everyone

## Development

ensure installed

- NodeJS v8

Note:
there is also a `npm` bash script which executes all commands within a docker container.
so you don't have to have local node/npm binaries. however, it is recommended to use a local
installation since this is much more performant. To use the `npm` script simply replace all
npm commands below with `./npm` (e.g. `./npm install` or `./npm run test`)

checkout this project

```
git clone git@github.com:synyx/tales.git
```

and install all dependencies

```
npm install
```

Then you can start the configured [webpack-dev-server] which provides the application
on `http://localhost:8080`

```
npm run dev
```

Hot Module Replacement ist enabled.  
So saving an edited JavaScript file for instance will update the opened Browsertab automatically 🎉

### Git hooks

Installing the project dependencies via `npm install` will setup following git hooks.

- **pre-commit**  
  The pre-commit hook formats all edited files with [prettier].

- **pre-push**  
  The pre-push hook will run the tests before anything is pushed to the origin.
